<body>
<h2> *EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Fruit Ninja is a simple game of slicing fruit. Holding the device sideways, players use their fingers to slice the pieces of fruit that jump into the screen. As the game progresses, more and more fruit come onto the screen, and players can slice multiple fruit at once to score combos. If a piece of fruit falls off the screen without being sliced however, the player earns an “X,” and if this happens two times the game is over. Also, bombs eventually appear on the screen, and if players slice those by accident they will also earn a game over screen. The goal is to rack up as many points as possible, while more and more fruit and bombs clutter the screen.
