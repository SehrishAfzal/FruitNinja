<body>
<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Fruit Ninja is a simple game of slicing fruit. Holding the device sideways, players use their fingers to slice the pieces of fruit that jump into the screen. As the game progresses, more and more fruit come onto the screen, and players can slice multiple fruit at once to score combos. If a piece of fruit falls off the screen without being sliced however, the player earns an “X,” and if this happens three times the game is over. Also, bombs eventually appear on the screen, and if players slice those by accident they will also earn a game over screen. The goal is to rack up as many points as possible, while more and more fruit and bombs clutter the screen.

<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>

This game helps kids practice their self control skills. While it may be tempting to slice the object right when they enter the screen, the game offers much incentive to avoid this knee-jerk reaction. Firstly, bombs are thrown up to fake players out, and if the don't use their inhibit their actions to keep their slices in check, they can easily earn a game over screen. The other reason its a good idea to not slice mindlessly is that if you cut multiple pieces of fruit at once, you score even more points than if you slice them individually. This entails waiting for just the right moment to slice the fruit when they are lined all up.</p>
